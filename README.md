# Research-Report-on-Common-Network-Security-Threats

## Objective
This report provides an in-depth analysis of common network security threats including *Denial of Service (DoS)* attacks, *Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)* attacks, and *spoofing*. It explores how each threat works, its real-world impact, and measures to mitigate these risks effectively.

## 1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

### What is a DoS Attack?
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic.

### How It Works:
- Attackers flood the target with excessive requests or data packets.
- Resources (CPU, RAM, bandwidth) get exhausted.
- Legitimate users are denied access to the service.

### Common Types:
- *Volume-based attacks* (e.g., UDP floods, ICMP floods)
- *Protocol attacks* (e.g., SYN floods)
- *Application layer attacks* (e.g., HTTP GET/POST floods)

### Real-World Example:
- *GitHub Attack (2018):* GitHub was hit by the largest DDoS attack ever recorded at that time, peaking at *1.35 Tbps*, exploiting Memcached servers.

### Mitigation Techniques:
- Rate limiting and traffic filtering
- Use of Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
- Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection services (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield)
- Redundant infrastructure and load balancing

## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

### What is a MITM Attack?
MITM is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

### How It Works:
- Attacker positions themselves between the client and server.
- Commonly used techniques:
  - ARP Spoofing
  - DNS Spoofing
  - HTTPS Hijacking
- Captures sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages.

### Real-World Example:
- *Superfish Incident (2015):* Lenovo laptops were found pre-installed with adware that performed HTTPS MITM attacks, compromising user security.

### Mitigation Techniques:
- Enforce *HTTPS/TLS encryption* (SSL certificates)
- Use *VPNs* for secure communication
- Implement *certificate pinning* in apps
- Avoid unsecured public Wi-Fi
- Enable *two-factor authentication (2FA)*

## 3. Spoofing Attacks

### What is Spoofing?
Spoofing refers to impersonating another device or user on a network to gain unauthorized access or spread malware.

### Types of Spoofing:
- *IP Spoofing:* Faking the source IP address to bypass filters/firewalls.
- *Email Spoofing:* Sending emails with forged sender addresses.
- *DNS Spoofing:* Redirecting users to malicious websites by corrupting DNS responses.
- *MAC Spoofing:* Changing MAC address to gain access to restricted networks.

### Real-World Example:
- *Sony PlayStation Network Hack (2011):* Attackers used IP spoofing to bypass firewalls and perform a large-scale data breach affecting over 77 million accounts.

### Mitigation Techniques:
- Use *packet filtering* and deep packet inspection
- Implement *Sender Policy Framework (SPF)* and *DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)* for email security
- DNSSEC for secure DNS validation
- Network segmentation and strong access control

## General Preventive Measures

| Measure | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Regular Patching | Keep systems and software updated to fix vulnerabilities. |
| Network Monitoring | Use IDS/IPS to detect suspicious activities in real-time. |
| Firewalls | Block unauthorized access and filter traffic. |
| User Awareness | Train employees on phishing, social engineering, and password hygiene. |
| Security Tools | Utilize antivirus, VPNs, endpoint protection, and SIEM tools. |

## Conclusion
Cyber threats like *DoS, **MITM, and **spoofing* are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent. Protecting against these attacks requires a multi-layered defense approach that includes *technical tools, good practices, and continuous vigilance*.

By understanding how these threats work and implementing strong security protocols, organizations and individuals can greatly reduce their risk exposure.
